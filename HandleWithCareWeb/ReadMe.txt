This is a Hackathon 2018 project "Handle with care: customers!"

This is an application for prototyping scheduling experience for new Office 365 customers
who want to schedule an in-person session at one of the Microsoft brick-and-mortar stores to ask questions or learn about Office suite features.

The web application uses jQuery framework.
It uses Bing Maps API for the Home page. To make it functional, you need to insert a valid Bing Maps API key around line 19 of the Home.html file.
It also uses DateTimePicker jQuery plugin (https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker) for the Calendar page.
